                <hr>
                <p>Hi, I'm a high school student with a deep passion for technology and coding. <br><br>Ever since I was young, I’ve been captivated by how digital tools and software shape our lives. I started experimenting with coding on my own, and as I learned, I realized the endless possibilities technology offers. What started as a personal interest soon grew into a mission: I wanted to not only sharpen my skills but also share what I’ve learned with others.<br><br> As I began building my own projects and experimenting with different languages, I saw the impact that coding can have on solving problems and making life easier. However, it wasn’t just about coding for me—it was about using those skills to make a difference.<br> <br>That's why I created this website: to showcase my journey as a developer and to give back to the community. I believe that everyone, no matter their background, can benefit from learning how to code, and this platform is my way of giving others the opportunity to do so while also making a positive impact in the world.</p>

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Through this platform, I aim to teach coding to others, share my experiences, and help people of all ages learn the power of programming. But it doesn’t stop there—I also want to use the funds raised here to support those in need, contributing to causes that uplift and empower underprivileged communities. My mission is simple: to combine my love for technology with my desire to make a positive impact, helping others learn and grow while supporting those who need it most.</p>
